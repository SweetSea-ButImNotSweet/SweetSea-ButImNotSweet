# **SweetSea-ButImNotSweet**

Hello, my nickname is **Squishy** (aka: **SweetSea**, **Sea-No-Sweet**; full: **SweetSea But-I'm-Not-Sweet**. I just coding for fun

> My old nickname is Hưng Harry. I'm currently drop it and never use it in now and future.

I can code in Python, Lua and C#. Frameworks I can code with are LÖVE and Godot. I don't learn frameworks or libraries if my current work does not need.
I currently don't familiar with many algorithms

I am currently not accept coding requests for now, so don't DM me for them (except if you will pay me some money and I can sort out to have a little of free time)

I am currently have some extra classes and have no free time for my coding hobby so you may see my profile not have much activities
